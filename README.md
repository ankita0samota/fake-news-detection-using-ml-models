# fake-news-detection-using-ml-models

## 📘 Project Overview
The rapid growth of digital news platforms has made the spread of fake news a serious global
problem. Fake or misleading information can influence public opinion, damage trust, and cause
social unrest. Manual verification of news content is slow and inefficient, making automated
solutions necessary. This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using machine learning
by analyzing textual content and classifying news as real or fake.

## 🏭 Industry Relevance
This project addresses a real-world industry problem and can be applied in:
- Social media platforms for automatic fake news flagging
- News publishing organizations for content verification
- Government and cyber security agencies for misinformation monitoring
- Online platforms aiming to reduce the spread of misleading information

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Automatically classify news articles as fake or real
- Compare the performance of multiple machine learning models
- Improve detection accuracy using ensemble and hybrid learning techniques

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow  
- NLTK  
- Pandas & NumPy  

## 📂 Dataset
Source: Kaggle  

The project uses two balanced datasets:
- Fake News Dataset (~20,000 articles)
- True News Dataset (~20,000 articles)

Balancing the datasets helps reduce bias and improves model reliability during training.

## ⚙ Methodology / Workflow
Data Collection → Text Preprocessing → Feature Extraction (TF-IDF) →  
Model Training → Model Evaluation

Text preprocessing includes tokenization, lowercasing, and stopword removal to improve
classification performance.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Gradient Boosting Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Naive Bayes  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)  
- Neural Networks  
- AdaBoost  
- Hybrid Models  

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Integration with real-time news and social media feeds  
- Multilingual fake news detection  
- Deployment as a web or mobile application  
- Use of deep learning and transformer-based models  
- Incorporation of explainable AI for better model transparency
